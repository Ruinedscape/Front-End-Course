# Front-End-Course
Software Development Skills: Front-End 2021-22

How to run the project (or coursework)
For the project:

Download the MyProject folder. Go to the MyProject folder, then go to the dist folder and open index.html in your browser
-> MyProject/dist/index.html

For the course work:
-> CourseWork/dist/index.html

Alternatively you can see the project running over at https://ruinedscape.github.io/

### Something to note ###
The project doesn't have any information about me and the text fields are all filled with filler text.
This is because I didn't think filling the project with trivial information about myself was relevant, since the project was about showcasing what I have learned on the course.
